<P>1. <B>Grant and Scope of License. </B>
<P align="justify">1.1 Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein,
Hericus grants to you ("User") a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
limited license to use the computer program(s) (individually referred to
herein as "Product" or collectively as "Products") for which valid
license keys have been issued by Hericus or its licensors or
expressly identified in an order letter, license certificate or other
document in written or electronic form provided by Hericus or its
licensors (an "Order Letter") and related manuals in written or
electronic form ("Documentation"). User's use of the Products shall be
limited to internal use and all such use shall be in accordance with the
provisions and limitations set forth in Exhibit A to this Agreement and
the Order Letter. The Products may include code to verify that User has
not exceeded the license keys issued by Hericus (the "Runtime License
Checker") and in the event that the Runtime License Checker determines
that User has exceeded its license the Products may cease to operate.
Hericus reserves all rights not expressly granted to User in this
Agreement.</P>

<P align="justify">1.2 User may not transfer, sell, assign or otherwise convey this
Agreement or the Products, by operation of law or otherwise, to any
other party. User may not sell, rent, license, or grant sublicenses,
leases, or other rights in the Products to others or otherwise allow the
Products to be accessed by another party. User shall have no right to
use the Products to provide time sharing services or act as or operate a
service bureau or provide subscription or hosting services for others,
nor to use the Products in or with any software application that is made
available on a time sharing, service bureau, subscription or hosting
basis. User may not use the Products to develop, test, support or market
products that are competitive with and/or provide similar functionality
to the Products. This Agreement automatically terminates if User
novates, assigns, sells, rents, licenses, grants, sublicenses, leases or
otherwise transfers possession of any copy of the Products or Product
Updates to another party or purports to do the same.
</P>
<P align="justify">1.3 For purposes of this Agreement a "Product Update" shall mean
any update, patch, version and/or new release of or to the Product that
Hericus furnishes generally to its customers who are on support in
accordance with Hericus's then current support policies and fee
requirements. A Product Update replaces part or all of a Product or
Product Update previously licensed to User and shall terminate such
previously licensed Product or Product Update to the extent replaced by
the Product Update. Product Updates shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of the license agreement accompanying the Product Update.
</P>
<P align="justify">1.4 User agrees to pay the applicable end user license fees, as
well as any applicable transportation charges and any value-added taxes
or other applicable taxes, tariffs or withholding taxes which the
relevant authorities require to pay, within thirty (30) days of date of
invoice.
</P>
<P align="justify">1.5 The term of this Agreement shall
be perpetual (unless otherwise specified), subject to termination in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2 below. The License Model
(as defined in Exhibit A) shall be in accordance with the terms of the
Order Letter or the license key issued for the product.
</P>
<P><B>2. Hericus's Rights. </B>
<P align="justify">2.1 The Products are proprietary products of Hericus or its
licensors (if any), and are protected by intellectual property law. By
virtue of this Agreement, User acquires only the non-exclusive right to
use the Products and does not acquire any rights of ownership or other
right in the Products, Documentation or the media upon which they are
embodied. Hericus or its licensors (if any) shall at all times retain
all right, title, and interest in the Products, Documentation and media.
Except as otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement, User
acquires no rights of any kind in or to any trade name, logo, or
trademark of Hericus or Hericus's affiliated companies or
licensors, or any product designation under which the Products were or
are marketed and shall not make use of the same for any reason except as
expressly authorized by this Agreement or otherwise authorized in
writing by Hericus.
</P>
<P align="justify">2.2 Hericus may terminate this Agreement by written notice if
User materially defaults in the performance of any provision of this
Agreement and fails to cure such default to the satisfaction of
Hericus within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of notice of
the default from Hericus. This remedy shall not be exclusive and
shall be in addition to any other remedies which Hericus may have
under this Agreement or otherwise. Within five (5) days after
termination of this Agreement for any reason or expiration of the term
of this Agreement (if applicable), User will return to Hericus or
destroy all copies of the Products and certify in writing to such return
or destruction of all copies of the Products.
</P>
<P align="justify"><B>3. Non-Disclosure; Copies; Alterations.</B> User acknowledges
that the Products are the valuable proprietary and trade secret
information of Hericus or its licensors (if any). User shall (i)
limit use and disclosure of the Products to its employees and to its
consultants who agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement; (ii)
not provide or disclose any of the Products to any other party without
the prior written consent of Hericus; and (iii) take all reasonable
precautions to maintain the confidentiality of the Products. User
agrees, under penalty of license termination but not exclusive of any
other remedies, not to cause or permit the reverse engineering,
modification, decryption, extraction, disassembly, copying, or
decompilation of the Product(s) (except as permitted by applicable law).
User may copy the Product(s) only for archival purposes. User may copy
the Documentation (in electronic format) solely for the purpose of
facilitating User's use of the Product(s) in accordance with, and
subject to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement. User may not
copy nor allow others to copy the Products or any Product Update, or any
portion thereof, for any purpose other than expressly set forth herein.
User agrees not to remove any product identification, copyright notices,
or other notices or proprietary restrictions from the Products and may
not disclose any information regarding any benchmark or similar tests of
the Product to any third party.
</P>
<P align="justify"><B>4. Limited Warranty and Disclaimers. </B>Hericus warrants
that for a period of thirty (30) days from User's purchase of the
license to use the Products ("Warranty Period"), that the Product media
will not be defective and that the copy of the Product delivered to you
conforms in all material respects to the Documentation. As the sole and
exclusive remedy for defective media, Hericus will repair or replace
free of charge such defective media during the Warranty Period provided
such defective media is returned to Hericus or its supplier within
the Warranty Period. As the sole and exclusive remedy for any failure of
the Product to materially conform to the Documentation, Hericus shall
repair, replace, or correct the Product if such failure is reported
during the Warranty Period or, if Hericus, at its discretion,
reasonably determines that such remedy is not economically or
technically feasible, this Agreement, and User's license hereunder, will
terminate and Hericus or its supplier (as applicable) shall provide a
full refund of the license fee paid with respect to the particular
Product. This warranty does not cover defects due to accident, abuse,
service or modification by User or any third party, or any other cause
occurring after initial delivery of the Product to User. This warranty
is made solely by Hericus and not its third-party suppliers, as
applicable. Hericus warrants that it has the right to license the
Products. Hericus will defend User against any claim based on an
allegation that a Product infringes a U.S. patent or copyright, but only
if Hericus is notified promptly in writing of such claim and is given
sole control of the defense thereof and all settlement negotiations
relating thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Hericus shall not be
liable to User for any claim arising from or based upon the alteration
or modification of any of the Products. THE LIMITED WARRANTY SPECIFIED
IN THIS SECTION 4 SETS FORTH THE ENTIRE WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS
PROVIDED BY HERICUS TO USER WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS. SUCH
LIMITED WARRANTY IS PROVIDED SOLELY BY HERICUS AND NOT HERICUS'S
LICENSORS. EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY PROVIDED SOLELY BY HERICUS
TO USER PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION 4, NEITHER HERICUS NOR ITS
LICENSORS, NOR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SUPPLIERS, MAKE ANY EXPRESS
WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS RELATING TO THE PRODUCTS OR ANY SERVICES
RELATED THERETO, AND FURTHER, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND
REPRESENTATIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS AND ANY SERVICES RELATED
THERETO. Without limiting the scope of the disclaimers set forth herein,
Hericus, for example, does not warrant that errors cannot arise
during the use of the Product(s). Further, the Product(s) are not fault
tolerant and are not designed, manufactured or intended for use in
hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance (including,
without limitation, the design, construction, operation or maintenance
of any nuclear facility; direct life support machines; weapon systems;
or control of aircraft, air traffic, aircraft navigation or aircraft
communications), in which the failure of the Product(s) could lead
directly or indirectly to death, personal injury or severe physical or
environmental damage. Without limiting the scope of the disclaimers set
forth herein, Hericus for itself and on behalf of its licensors and
their respective suppliers, disclaims any express or implied warranty of
fitness for any such high risk uses. THE LIMITED WARRANTY SPECIFIED IN
THIS SECTION 4 GIVES THE USER SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND MAY ALSO IMPLY
OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW
THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION ON HOW LONG ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO
THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY.
</P>
<P align="justify"><B>5. Limitation of Liability.</B> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LIABILITY OF HERICUS, IF ANY, FOR
DAMAGES RELATING TO ANY PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE
ACTUAL AMOUNTS PAID BY USER FOR SUCH PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES.
HERICUS'S LICENSORS AND THEIR SUPPLIERS SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO
USER FOR ANY DAMAGES SUFFERED BY USER OR ANY THIRD PARTY AS A RESULT OF
USING THE PRODUCTS, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, OR AS A RESULT OF ANY
SERVICES RELATING THERETO. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IN NO EVENT
SHALL HERICUS, ITS LICENSORS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SUPPLIERS BE
LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR INDIRECT, PUNITIVE,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, HOWEVER
CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF THE USE
OR INABILITY TO USE THE PRODUCTS, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, OR ANY
SERVICES, EVEN IF HERICUS, ITS LICENSORS AND/OR ANY OF THEIR
RESPECTIVE SUPPLIERS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY. EACH
EXCLUSION OF LIMITATION IS INTENDED TO BE SEPARATE AND THEREFORE
SEVERABLE EXCLUSION.
</P>
<P align="justify"><B>6. Export Regulations.</B> The Products, including technical
data, are subject to U.S. export control laws, including, without
limitation, the U.S. Export Administration Act and its associated
regulations, and may be subject to export or import regulations in other
countries. User shall not directly or indirectly export or re-export the
Products, or the direct product thereof, without first obtaining
Hericus's written approval. User agrees to comply strictly with all
regulations and acknowledges that it has the responsibility to obtain
licenses to export, re-export or import the Products. The Products may
not be downloaded, or otherwise exported or re-exported (i) into, or to
a national or resident of, Cuba, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Libya, Sudan,
Syria, Taliban and areas of Afghanistan controlled by the Taliban, or
any country to which the U.S. has embargoed goods; or (ii) to anyone on
the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nations or
the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Denial Orders as amended from
time to time.
</P>
<P align="justify"><B>7. U.S. Government Restricted Rights.</B> If the Products are
being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or by a U.S.
Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), then the
U.S. Government's rights in the Products will be only as set forth
herein. Each such Product is a "commercial component," as this term is
defined in 48 C.F.R. "2.101, consisting of "commercial computer
software" and "computer software documentation," as such terms are
defined in 48 C.F.R. "252.227-7014(a)(1) and 48 C.F.R.
"252.227-7014(a)(5), respectively, and used in 48 C.F.R. "12.212 and 48
C.F.R. "227.7202, as applicable, and all as amended from time to time.
Consistent with 48 C.F.R. "12.212 and 48 C.F.R. "227.7202, and other
relevant sections of the Code of Federal Regulations, as applicable, and
all as amended from time to time, all U.S. Government entities acquire
this Product only with those rights set forth in the license agreement
accompanying the Product. Contractor/manufacturer is Hericus Software, LLC., 
14019 Southwest Freeway Suite #301-426, Sugar Land, TX 77478. 
Unpublished "all rights reserved under the
copyright laws of the United States".
</P>
<P align="justify"><B>8. Records Inspection and Auditing of Usage.</B> User shall
maintain books and records in connection with User's actions under this
Agreement. Such records shall include at a minimum the number of
licenses purchased and being used by User. Upon the request of
Hericus, User agrees to provide a declaration signed by an authorized
representative certifying as to the actual number of units (for example
users, servers, CPUs per server, connections, or operating systems, as
applicable and as defined in Exhibit A) of the Product(s) currently in
use by User. Hericus may, at its expense: (a) have Hericus or a
third party audit the records of User to ensure compliance with the
terms of this Agreement, (b) bundle, install, enable and utilize
automated license tracking, management, and/or enforcement solutions
with the Products, which User may not disrupt nor alter, (c) require
User to demonstrate the accuracy of the records referenced herein, (d)
visit the premises of User and inspect User's use of the Product(s) and
(e) evaluate User's network monitoring software or monitoring
capabilities to confirm that it adequately protects against User's
breach of the provisions of this Agreement and the license granted
hereunder. All audits shall be conducted during regular business hours
at User's offices and shall not interfere unreasonably with User's
activities. If any audit reveals that User has underpaid license and/or
support fees to Hericus, User shall be invoiced for such underpaid
license and/or support fees based on Hericus's list price in effect
at the time the audit is conducted. If the underpaid license and/or
support fees are in excess of five percent (5%) of the license fees
previously paid by User, then User shall pay Hericus's reasonable
costs of conducting the audit and enforcement of this Agreement.
</P>
<P align="justify"><B>9. Support.</B> If Hericus offers support and User orders
and pays for such support, it shall be provided in accordance with
Hericus's then current technical support policies.
</P>
<P align="justify"><B>10. Miscellaneous.</B> THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY EXHIBITS,
SCHEDULES, AND/OR ORDER LETTERS EXPRESSLY REFERENCED HEREIN, CONSTITUTES
THE COMPLETE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS
AND, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS SECTION 10, SUPERCEDES
ANY OTHER AGREEMENT, COMMUNICATION OR ADVERTISING, ORAL OR WRITTEN, WITH
RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS. To the extent there are any terms and
conditions contained in User's purchase order or other documentation
supplied by User ("User Documents"), the terms and conditions contained
in the User Documents shall be deemed to be stricken and the terms and
conditions of this Agreement shall govern. In the event of a conflict
between the provisions of this Agreement and the specific provisions set
forth in an Order Letter, the provisions of the Order Letter shall
control. This Agreement has been drawn up in English at the express wish
of the parties. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, this
Agreement is governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Texas,
without regard to its choice of law principles, and without regard to
the provisions of any state Uniform Computer Information Transactions
Act or similar federal, national or state laws or regulations. The
parties expressly disclaim the application of the United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. If the
Products are acquired outside the United States and local law is
required, such local law shall apply. If any provision of this Agreement
is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be limited, modified
or severed as necessary to eliminate its unenforceability, and all other
provisions shall remain unaffected. Hericus's failure to enforce any
provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such
provision.
</P>
<P align="justify">EXHIBIT A
<P><B>License Model</B> Depending on the Products licensed in the
Order Letter, the license grant listed in Section 1 is subject to the
following descriptions and use restrictions:
</P>
<P align="justify"><B>(a) Authorized User Basis.</B> If the Product is licensed on
an Authorized User basis, the Product may be used on a single computing
machine which may be accessed by the number of Authorized Users
specified in the Order Letter. An Authorized User is a single individual
who has been designated to use the Product. In no event shall the number
of persons authorized to have access to the Product exceed the number of
Authorized Users identified in the Order Letter. The right to use the
Product is not based on concurrent users, but instead on an actual
"Authorized User" basis. User must, upon request by Hericus, identify
each Authorized User who will have access to the Product and provide
that information to Hericus.
</P>
<P align="justify"><B>(b) Workstation Basis.</B> If the Product is licensed on a
Workstation basis, each Workstation using or accessing the Product must
be licensed. A license must be purchased for each Workstation using or
accessing the Product. A "Workstation" shall be defined as a computer
that is operated, either attended or via remote access, by one person at
a time, and cannot be used by more than one person, directly or
indirectly, simultaneously. In no event shall the number of workstations
utilizing or accessing the Product exceed the number of Workstations
identified in the Order Letter.
</P>
<P align="justify"><B>(c) Server Basis.</B> If the Product is licensed on a Server
basis, then a license fee must be paid for the maximum number of
processors ("CPUs") utilized by the Server whether or not such access is
simultaneous or consecutive. Servers utilizing dual core processing (or
multiple core processing) or other multi-processor technology shall have
each core processor count as one (1) CPU. The Product may only be used
by server-based applications running on that server accessed by other
computers and may not be installed via file sharing on a local area
network file system. A "Server" shall be defined as a logical computer
with one or more CPUs on which the Product resides, along with the
applications utilizing the Product, and which can be accessed by other
computers. The term "Server" includes, but is not limited to, web
servers, batch servers and application servers.
</P>
<P align="justify"><B>(d) Evaluation Basis.</B> If the Product is licensed on an
Evaluation basis, then it is licensed on a Workstation basis or a Server
basis for fifteen (15) days from download or receipt (as the case may
be) unless a different term is listed in an Order Letter, subject to the
additional restriction that it be used solely for evaluation of software
applications and not in conjunction with the development or deployment
of such software applications in production. NOTWITHSTANDING THE
PROVISIONS OF SECTION 4 OF THE AGREEMENT, USER UNDERSTANDS AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) PRODUCT LICENSED ON AN EVALUATION BASIS IS
PROVIDED "AS-IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED
OR ARISING BY CUSTOM OR TRADE USAGE AND SPECIFICALLY MAKES NO WARRANTY
OF MERCHANTABILITY OR OF FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
NONINFRINGEMENT AND (ii) THE EVALUATION VERSION OF THE PRODUCT CONTAINS
A DISABLING DEVICE THAT WILL AUTOMATICALLY DISABLE THE EVALUATION
VERSION AT THE END OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD. Pursuant to Section 2.2 of
the Agreement, User acknowledges and agrees that within five (5) days
after expiration of the term of the evaluation period or earlier
termination, as the case may be, User will return to Hericus or
destroy all copies of the Products and certify in writing to such return
or destruction of all copies of the Products. User further acknowledges
and agrees that the evaluation period may not be extended by
uninstalling and re-installing the Product or by any other means other
than Hericus's written consent.
</P>
<P>(e) Additional Use Parameters.
<P align="justify"><B>(1) Application Specific.</B> If the Order Letter lists a
specific application authorized for use with the Product, or if User
obtained a Product in conjunction with a software application provided
by a third party, the Product is licensed for use only with such
application. Use with any other application/product is strictly
prohibited.
</P>
<P align="justify"><B>(2) Term.</B> If the Order Letter specifies that User's
license to the Products is for a term ("Term"), then the term of this
Agreement and User's license to the Products hereunder shall expire on
the expiration date stated in the Order Letter, unless sooner terminated
in accordance with Section 1.6 of the Agreement. Upon completion of the
Term, User shall return all Products licensed under the Order Letter and
associated documentation and related information (including all copies)
to Hericus, or certify its destruction in a writing delivered to
Hericus. All license rights in and to the Products under the terms of
the Agreement shall terminate at the end of the Term.
</P>

<P align="justify"><B>(3) </B> the Product may contain programs that
perform automated collection of system data and transmit said data to
equipment owned or under the control of Hericus in order to verify
that (i) User is entitled to use Product, and/or (ii) User has not
exceeded the license keys issued by Hericus (the "Runtime License
Checker") and in the event that the Runtime License Checker determines
that User has exceeded its license or is not entitled to use the
Product, the Products may cease to operate.
</P>
<P align="justify"><B>(4) Zed Builds And Bugs</B> utilizes a Java Virtual Machine and is
subject to additional terms and conditions. User may not may not create,
