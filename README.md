Helix
=====

Open Source MVC framework for building Web Applications using Java, C++, or C#

While working at Hericus Software, LLC I created an MVC framework in both Java and C++
that made it very easy to build a web application that targeted any type of back-end
database system.

With this release of Helix, I and Hericus Software have decided to release the framework
as open source for all versions of the framework: Java, C++, and C#.  This is the base code
used to create the Zed Builds and Bugs application, and has been used in other commercial
development projects.

The framework leverages code-generation in as many ways as possible to eliminate hand-coding
of the details.  This keeps the amount of code manually written small and focused on implementing
the true business logic.

The 3 versions of this framework ensure that you can apply this solution to your project
regardless of whether you are a Java shop, C++ shop, or .Net shop.

Nightly builds of the framework are handled by Zed Builds and Bugs and pre-packaged downloads 
are graciously hosted by Hericus Software, LLC.
